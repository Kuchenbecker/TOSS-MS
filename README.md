# TOSS-MS
Tools for Organize Spectrum from Mass Spectrometry (MS). Includes many scripts such as convertion and plotting.
This is still a personal project that aim to facilitate conversion and treatment of .raw data from ThermoScientific Tandem MS & MS/MS.
For now it should have:
1. Script for batch conversion of .raw files into .msXML using local ProteoWizard
2. Script for Molecular Formula (elemental composition) calculation
3. Script for customized plotting
4. Script for customized analysis report.
5. Script for retreiving molecular formula data from the MS/MS Spectra and parse it into ForMileS program for fragment ion structure generation in a batch automatic manner.
