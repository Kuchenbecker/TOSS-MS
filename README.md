## Tools for Organize Spectrum from Mass Spectrometry (MS)

Tools for Organize Spectrum from Mass Spectrometry (MS). Includes many scripts such as convertion and plotting.
This is still a personal project aiming to facilitate conversion and treatment of **.raw file** data from ThermoScientific Tandem MS & MS/MS and EI-MS.
For now it should have:
1. Script for plotting Spectrum from .msML and/or .txt files. Name: **PLOS - Plotting Organized Mass Spectrum**
2. Script for generating atomic composition (molecular formula) for each fragment ion. Name: **AtoMS - Atomic composition of Mass Spectrum**
 
3. Script for batch conversion of .raw files into .msXML using local ProteoWizard or ThermoParse ***Not Implemented yet***
4. Script for customized analysis report ***Not Implemented yet***
5. Script for retreiving molecular formula data from the MS/MS Spectra and parse it into ForMileS program for fragment ion structure generation in a batch automatic manner ***Not Implemented yet***
